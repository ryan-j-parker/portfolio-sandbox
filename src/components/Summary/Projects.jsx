      'An interactive music app that renders color gradients in a dynamic 3D environment when notes are played on a virtual piano keyboard. Built with a team of 5 in a 4-day sprint, using React, React Three Fiber, React Piano, the Soundfont audio library, and the WebAudio API. Users can customize their experience with a GUI built with Leva, which allows for modifications to the 3D geometries, materials, color, lighting, and more. The app also includes a comprehensive walkthrough tutorial!',
